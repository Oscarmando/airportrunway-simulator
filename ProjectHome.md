This project was designed to simulate the airport runway control.
The simulator will simulate the landing and take-off sequence during a set period.
By giving the average number of arrival flights and the average number of departing flights, the simulator will randomly generate arrival flights and departing flights.
Then, it will decide which flight will use the runway.
By the end of the simulation, the application will print out a list of data, such as average wait time for arrival and departing, the maximum wait time, etc. .
